The Undecided is a Neutral role who is given 1 minute to "vote" for one of 3 randomly selected roles from a "ballot". They become the role that they vote for (they also get an "I VOTED" sticker, which offers no in-game benefit). If they do not vote within the allotted time, they become a Jester (or an Innocent if the Jester isn't installed) instead. The server owner can configure it so some other bad thing happens instead of becoming a Jester (ex. DEATH).
 
[h1]How the Ballot is Generated[/h1]
The ballot is generated by first separating the roles that the server has installed (and are valid for the current round) into 5 groups:
1. Innocents (excluding detectives)
2. Detectives
3. Traitors
4. Evil (roles with unique teams. Ex. Serial Killer, Jester, Infected, Marker, Doppelganger)
5. Neutral (Anything that doesn't fit the above 4 groups. Ex. Amnesiac, Drunk, Cursed, Medic)
 
Roles will only be present in the above groups if they could have been selected as starting roles.
Example 1: The Sidekick, Thrall, and Graverobber roles won't be present as they are secondary roles which only appear due to in-game events.
Example 2: The minimum number of players is considered. If 9 players are required for a player to be given the Medic role, but only 6 players are present on the server, then the Medic will not appear on the ballot.
 
Each group has a ConVar that determines its weight, which is used for random selection. The five weights do not have to add up to 100, but it will save you some headaches if they do. For example, if they add up to 100 and ttt2_undecided_weight_innocent is 35, then there is a 35% chance that an Innocent role will be chosen as a selectable option. These weights apply to each entry of the ballot, meaning that that if the ballot has 3 entries then it is possible for each entry to be an Innocent role.
 
A role cannot appear on the ballot multiple times.
 
This role offers support for the following roles that hide their true identity from the player: Shinigami, Wrath, and Lycanthrope. If the server has these roles installed, then they (along with the base Innocent role) will appear as "Innocent*". The player who selects "Innocent*" will [i]probably[/i] become a special Innocent, but they can't know for certain. "Innocent*" can appear on the ballot multiple times, but each entry will correspond to a different role that has been obscured.
 
It is possible for the Undecided role to appear on the ballot. If the Undecided votes for their own role the ballot will be re-rolled and the timer reset.
 
Naturally, this role works best on servers that have numerous roles installed, but a miminalist server is supported. The ballot generation logic is semi-intelligent, and will adjust itself if one or more of the 5 groups is empty.

Convars are variables that are introduced to allow server owners to customize the gameplay without changing the code. There are always a handful of convars automatically created by TTT2, that define the spawn parameters of this role and are found in ULX. Additionally there might be some role specific convars, which have to be set in the server config file.
